# Rational numbers

A [rational number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number)
is a number that can be expressed as the fraction of two integers;

## Reduce


Rational expressions should be reduced to the lowest terms. For
example you shall write $\frac{3}{4}$ rather than $\frac{9}{12}$.

1. factorize the numerator and denominator
2. Cancel common factors
3. Compute the result

$$
\frac{210}{924} =
\frac{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 11} =
\frac{\cancel{2} \cdot \cancel{3} \cdot 5 \cdot \cancel{7}}
     {\cancel{2} \cdot 2 \cdot \cancel{3} \cdot \cancel{7} \cdot 11} =
\frac{5}{2 \cdot 11} = \frac{5}{22}
$$

The factors are prime numbers, numbers > 1 that can't be divided by
anything except 1 and themselves;

$$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, \cdots $$

There are [tools](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/prime-factors.php)
that can help factorizing (try 210 and 924).
