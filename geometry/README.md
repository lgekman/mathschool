# Geometry

A useful and *fun* area in mathematics.

## What happens with circumference and area when scaling?

<img src="rectanglex2.svg" width="50%" />

The rectangle is scaled by 2 (it's dimensions are doubled).

* How much longer is the circumference (omkrets)?

* How much larger is the area?

* Same questions if the rectangle is scaled by 3

* Same questions if the rectangle is scaled by `X`?
  Invent a formula. Use `a`=original area, `c`=original circumference,
  `A`=scaled area, `C`=scaled circumference.

In this figure the star is scaled by 2.

* Do you think your formula works for the star? That is, it you
  formula generic?

If it takes 1 hour for Lars to move the lawn on a 25x25m area, how
long will it take to move the lawn on a 50x50m area?

<hr />

When the rectangles dimensions are doubled the circumference is also
doubled but the area becomes 4 times larger.

If the rectangle is scaled by 3 the circumference becomes 3 times
longer as well, but the area becomes 9 times larger.

Formula;

C = X * c

A = X * X * a

Or;

A = X<sup>2</sup> * a

And yes, *the formula is generic*. It works for *any* 2-dimensional shape.

It will take 4 hours to move the lawn on a 50x50m area.
